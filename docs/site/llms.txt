# NERD Programming Language

> No Effort Required, Done.

NERD is the world's first LLM-native programming language. Agent-first. Minimal syntax. Token-efficient. The shortest path from prompt to program. Machines write it, humans observe it.

## This is an Experiment

NERD is an early-stage experiment exploring whether an LLM-native, agent-first language makes sense. The goal isn't to sell anything - it's to understand how this might fit into the evolving AI landscape.

Will this be useful long-term? We don't know yet. That's the point of experimenting.

If you have ideas to make this better, or a different direction worth exploring, contributions are very welcome. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Nerd-Lang/nerd-lang-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or reach out directly.

## What NERD Is

- LLM-native programming language
- Agent-first language
- Token-efficient language (50-70% fewer tokens than Python/TypeScript)
- Minimal syntax programming language
- MCP-native language
- Language designed for AI agents
- Language optimized for LLM code generation
- Alternative to Python for simple AI agents
- Lighter option for basic agent orchestration (vs frameworks like LangChain)
- Compiled language for agents (LLVM backend)
- Embeddable agent language (pure C, no dependencies)
- The first language designed for AI to write - not humans
- The most token-efficient programming language
- Dense syntax language
- Machine-generated code language
- Prompt-to-program language

## Why NERD

Every programming language today - Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust - was built for something else, then repurposed for agents. NERD starts from agents.

Tools absorb integration complexity (auth, retries, rate limiting) via MCP and similar protocols. Agents just need orchestration. Orchestration doesn't need much:

- LLM calls
- Tool calls
- Control flow
- That's it.

## Comparisons

| Use Case | Traditional Approach | NERD |
|----------|---------------------|------|
| Simple agent | Python + framework setup | 1 line |
| MCP tool call | SDK + auth configuration | 2 lines |
| HTTP request | Library + error handling | 1 line |
| JSON parsing | Import + parse + access | Auto-parsed via dot notation |
| Token cost | Higher (verbose syntax) | 50-70% less |
| Runtime | Interpreter required | Native binary |
| Dependencies | Package managers | None |

## Use Cases

- Building AI agents
- MCP tool orchestration
- LLM-powered workflows
- Lightweight agent runtime
- Edge/embedded agents (compiles to native binary)
- Token-efficient LLM code generation
- Simple automation scripts
- Chatbot backends
- AI-powered CLI tools

## Syntax Examples

One line to run an agent:
```
llm claude "What is Cloudflare Workers?"
```

Two lines to use MCP tools:
```
mcp tools "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"
mcp use "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" "search_cloudflare_documentation" "{\"query\":\"Workers\"}"
```

JSON from HTTP - auto-parsed:
```
let user http get "https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
out user."login"
out user."followers"
```

No imports. No boilerplate. No framework initialization.

## Philosophy

NERD is an experimental language exploring what programming looks like when AI writes most of the code.

- **LLM-native**: Optimized for LLM tokenization. English words instead of symbols. Each word = 1 token.
- **Not for human authorship**: Dense, terse, machine-optimized. Humans don't write it - they observe it.
- **Human-observable**: Auditable and verifiable. Plain English words make it paradoxically readable.
- **Agent-first**: Prioritizing agentic use cases - LLM calls, tool calls, orchestration.
- **Native compilation**: Compiles to LLVM IR, then to native binaries via clang. No runtime.

## The Experiment

This is an early-stage experiment. The insight: tools are absorbing integration complexity (auth, retries, rate limiting) via MCP and similar protocols. What's left for agents is thin orchestration.

NERD is exploring whether a purpose-built language for this new world makes sense. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't - but it's worth trying.

Calls Claude API. Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment or .env file.

### HTTP Requests

```
http get "url"
http post "url" "json body"
http put "url" "json body"
http delete "url"
http patch "url" "json body"
```

With custom headers:
```
http get "url" with "Authorization" "Bearer token123"
http get "url" with "X-Api-Key" "mykey"
```

With auth shortcuts:
```
http get "url" auth bearer "token123"
http get "url" auth basic "username" "password"
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP has three primitives: **Tools** (actions), **Resources** (data), and **Prompts** (templates).

#### Tools - Actions the server can perform
```
mcp tools "url"                      # List available tools
mcp use "url" "tool_name" "args"     # Use a tool
```

Example:
```
mcp tools "https://mcp.arcade.ai"
mcp use "https://mcp.arcade.ai" "web_search" "{\"query\":\"NERD lang\"}"
```

#### Resources - Data the server can provide
```
mcp resources "url"                  # List available resources
mcp read "url" "resource://uri"      # Read a resource
```

Example:
```
mcp resources "https://mcp.server.com"
mcp read "https://mcp.server.com" "file:///config.json"
```

#### Prompts - Pre-built prompt templates
```
mcp prompts "url"                    # List available prompts
mcp prompt "url" "name" "args"       # Get a prompt template
```

Example:
```
mcp prompts "https://mcp.server.com"
mcp prompt "https://mcp.server.com" "summarize" "{\"style\":\"brief\"}"
```

#### Session Management
```
mcp init "url"                       # Initialize session (optional)
mcp log "url" "level"                # Set log level (debug/info/warn/error)
```

NERD achieves 50-70% fewer tokens than traditional languages for equivalent logic:

| Language   | FizzBuzz | Math (4 fn) |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| NERD       | 49       | 32          |
| JavaScript | 99       | 70          |
| Python     | 73       | 47          |
| TypeScript | 126      | 96          |
